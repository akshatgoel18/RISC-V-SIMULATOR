Contributions:-

__Everyone in the team have put lot of efforts for the completion of Phase3__
  	And everyone has supported and helped eachother in their work. 

As dependencies were more in this phase,so we worked in group of two.

::Akshat and Ujjwal::
- Build upon phase2 source codes and made it pipelined 
     - with dataforwarding
     - without dataforwarding but stalling
- Included inter-state pipeline buffer registers 
- Changed the data path and control path to support pipelining
- Included control and data hazards detection unit
- Included data forwarding logic , stall logic
- Included functionality to print register and pipeline buffers

::Sathwik and Aman::
- Implemented 1 bit branch predictor
- Changed the data path and control path to support branch prediction
- Created branch prediction hardware (BHT + BTB indexed using PC)
- Included branch prediction logic and BTB updation
- Included flush logic (on a miss)
- Included input knobs to support different modes

::Rohit::    
- Upgraded GUI to include functionalities required and its integration with the source codes.
- Included STEP button to simulate instructions step-wise 
- Included options to simulate RISC-V code on different modes 
- Included block diagram of the 5 pipeline stages
- Displayed stats of the program and instruction execution details

HOW TO RUN:
-----------
	/RISC_SIMULATOR/Phase3
        On the terminal :-   cmd$ python3 "MAIN.py"
			     Enter 1 to open GUI and 2 to continue in terminal

	/RISC_SIMULATOR/with GUI
        - run python3 "simulator_front_end.py"        
	On the GUI:-  Enter the code in editor pane and simulate 
        

FEATURES:
---------
    Functionality to switch modes
        1. Non- pipelined
        2. Pipelined with stalls
        3. Pipelined with Data forwarding
	4. Enable 1 bit Predictor
    
    Functionality to output register values and values of the inter state buffers

    Functionality to see inter state buffer register values of a particular instruction (of user choice)

    Showes the number of mispredictions, number of stalls, and other stats

    Functionality to print register values and inter state buffers after every cycle.

    GUI :- Used Python Tkinter Library
